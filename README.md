- **DO NOT** Attack alliances we have pacts with, or those with significantly more members than us. **THIS IS IMPORTANT**

##Uranium
- Report all Uranium discovery to officers ASAP
- Nuclear reactors take a while to produce and therefore unadvised to persue unless you have the uranium and resources to safely work on it, if you are working towards nuclear reactors and nukes you must contact an officer ASAP and inform them so they are aware and can provide aid or protection in case you become a target.


#Officer guidelines, roles and regulations.

##Guidelines
- All officers should be of a friendly nature and not discriminate against members of the alliance and treat all members fairly as well as ensuring positive external relations to ensure the safety of the alliance members and avoid conflict with other alliances.

##Roles
###All officers
- Officers should check on members every 3-5 days at least to see if they require assistance or would like extra help to speed up growth.
- If a member is losing a war an officer must provide assistance to win the war and and preferrably attempt to get the other nation to sign a peace agreement with the nation under attack and end the war peacefully. There is an alliance budget for signing peace treaties currently of 500k-1000k of the treaty cost the officer can reimburse from the alliance.
